# spin-models

This repository is dedicated for my recent research and studies into spin models. Simpliest spin models, such as Ising or voter, are used extensively to study opinion dynamics in sociophysics. For my bachelor thesis research I used spin models to create and identify spatial structures, such as domains, clusters. Spatiality is a new look into dynamics proposed by statistical physics models since temporal change is already widely studied. This also makes more sense from sociophysics point of view - empirical and experimental data is more often available in different scales and/or geographical distributions rather than time-scale.
